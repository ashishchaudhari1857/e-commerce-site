            intelligent machines that can understand, learn, and solve complex
            problems, ultimately enhancing human capabilities and improving
            efficiency in various domains Machine Learning: This involves
            training machines to learn from data and make predictions or
            decisions without being explicitly programmed. It includes various
            techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
            reinforcement learning.
